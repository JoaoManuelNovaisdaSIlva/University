# Web Engineering

- This course aims for students to be able to develop web applications using both the client-server model and a microservices architecture. They will also learn how to specify web components that integrate the three essential parts: model, style, and control logic. Furthermore, students will be able to implement data persistence in NoSQL databases or in files such as XML, JSON and CSV. They will also learn how to develop authentication systems, using both traditional credentials and temporary tokens, and acquire a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The unit program ranges from the anatomy of a web page, including HTML and CSS, to the creation of websites with structured navigation. It then focuses on building web applications, covering data persistence, user interface, and control logic. Students will learn how to develop small web servers using asynchronous programming and how to implement REST APIs through the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. The course also includes data API development and rapid API prototyping with file persistence. Additionally, students will be introduced to data persistence using NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and learn to use the MongoDB query language to perform operations such as data selections, projections, and aggregations.

Other important topics include developing dynamic interfaces, using templating engines like Jade/Pug and EJS to generate HTML pages, and manipulating the DOM to create client-side interactions. The unit also covers downloading and uploading files in web applications and transitioning from a single-service architecture to a microservices architecture. Finally, students will learn how to implement basic authentication in client-server applications and adapt authentication systems for microservices architectures, addressing the specific challenges of this approach.
